# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Requirement

**ALL** code changes must be made according to this test-driven development process: **TESTS GET WRITTEN FIRST!** Strictly follow the four steps laid out below, in order, for every code change. **NEVER** skip ahead to making code changes without following this process!

## 1. Determine Scope

1. Determine scope of necessary code changes
2. Determine necessary behaviors to test
3. Determine the correct locations in the existing test infrastructure for those tests
	- Determine if new test suites must be added
	- Determine if test cases must be added to existing test suites
	- Determine if existing test cases must be modified
	- **IMPORTANT:** If you cannot locate existing test infrastructure, **STOP AND ASK** what to do.

## 2. Preparation (Stubbing)

1. **Stub new tests:** create any necessary test suites and/or test cases, with **empty implementations**
	- If the test signature is not self-descriptive, include multi-line comments on the test suites and test cases explaining the behaviors they are supposed to test.
	- **IMPORTANT:** do not implement any tests yet!
2. **Stub the interface:** add any new functions, classes, etc to the codebase with **empty implementations**
	- include full function and/or class signatures, etc
	- include full multi-line comment documentation in the style already in use in the project *or* the industry standard for the language(s) in use if the project has no prior art
	- **IMPORTANT:** do not implement any of the actual code changes yet!
3. **Modify existing tests:** modify any existing tests as needed to correctly test for the new behavior

## 3. Write Tests

1. **Implement the Tests**: Fill out the implementations of all the empty tests you wrote.
2. **Run the Tests:** Run the tests you wrote. All your new tests should fail; that is expected and means you did it right.

## 4. Write Code

Only write code after all tests have been created, stubbed, documented, and implemented.

1. Start with the first failing test
2. Implement the required code to make that test pass
3. Run the tests
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all tests pass
